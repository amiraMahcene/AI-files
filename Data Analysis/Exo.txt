    Why? Messy data can lead to incorrect conclusions.
    How?
        Remove duplicate records.
        Fix errors (e.g., missing scores, incorrect names).
        Standardize format (e.g., all dates in "YYYY-MM-DD" format).
üîπ Step 1: Fill in Missing Values

We'll handle missing data (?) based on logical assumptions:

    Age: If unknown, estimate based on grade level or similar students.
    Math Grades: Replace missing grades with the average of the student‚Äôs other grades.
    Study Hours: If missing, assume the class average.
    Learning Style: If unknown, use teacher feedback or assume a general style.
    Sleep Hours: If missing, assume the class average.
    
üîπ Step 2: Standardize Data Formats

    Attendance: Convert all values into a numeric format (X absences instead of vague terms).
    Participation: Use a uniform scale (High, Medium, Low).
    Teacher Feedback: Summarize into structured categories (Needs Improvement, Average, Strong).
 üîπ Step 3: Remove Inconsistencies

    Yes/No Values: Standardize (Yes ‚Üí 1, No ‚Üí 0).
    Homework Completion: Convert Sometimes to percentages (50%).
